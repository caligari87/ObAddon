# ObAddon

An addon for Oblige 7.70, adding multiple new elements.

## PREFABS

Adds a HUGE library of prefabricates to decorate maps, a collection spanning months of work including decorative walls, doodads, and functional pieces such as stairs, joiners, teleporters, start rooms, joining pieces, and lifts.

  
## EXTENSIONS

* Procedural Gotchas! Massive procedurally generated arenas with increased challenge (and bosses), with customizable difficulty.

* PsYcHeDeLiC theme.

* Layout Absurdification! This module attempts to create more interesting maps by forcing certain shape rules in the grammar set to be much more prominent than normal.
  
* Toggle for turning prebuilt levels on or off.
  
* Exposed parameters for the Sky Generator such as day/night and mountain settings. Play an entire generated WAD at night mood... for the mood.

* Expanded controls for monster setting, such as trap style, monster mix-it-up fine tune, and monster placement inside secrets.

* LOTS and LOTS of new shape rules such as new steepness shapes, new liquid shapes, new shape of all sorts. Above 200% more shapes than vanilla! (or at least 200% new lines...)

* Prefab Control module - can control the amount of detail desired for the map, for your visual preference or for stability.

* Expanded prefab error reporting - you too, can make your own fabs and test them out.

* Rudimentary support for prefabricated ZDoom 3D skyboxes.

* New vista types, such as bottomless pits (ZDoom only) and liquid oceans.

* Buildings with windows that open into vistas.

* Experimental "Stretched-Out" size tries to make the map stretchy and longitudinal.

* New control to select ceiling and floor sink styles: curved and flowy, or sharp and angular.

AND MORE TO COME!
