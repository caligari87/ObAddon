# ObAddon

A repository of new features, enhancements, and an extensive library of community-built prefabs for [Oblige 7.70](http://oblige.sourceforge.net/).

New: For Windows x64 users, [**a win64 executable for Oblige 7.70**](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=64879) is now available which addresses memory issues in creating large megawads, boosts performance, and prompts the user in taskbar when map building is complete.  Credit to Sumwunn for this!

## Community
Currently, the Oblige community resides on an unofficial Discord server since the official forums were shut down. You may join us at the following link:

If you wish to more directly participate in ObAddon's development, the project is completely open to contributions from simply new prefabs to new script modules!

* `git clone https://github.com/caligari87/ObAddon ObAddon`
* `cd ObAddon`
* `cd scripts`
* `make`

* Open the `src/` folder.
* Add the contents of the folder to a compressed / zipped folder named ObAddon.

## Features

### Prefabs
Adds a HUGE library of prefabricates to decorate maps, a collection spanning **more than a year** of work including decorative walls, doodads, and functional pieces such as stairs, joiners, teleporters, start rooms, joining pieces, and lifts contributed by different authors! **YOU TOO** can contribute!

### Extensions

#### New Level Layouts!

* Streets mode! Create a map composed of largely outdoor street-like zones from which rooms (buildings!) will sprout from!

* Linear mode! Don't want to get lost navigating through a maze of doors? It's only a walk forward from start to finish without branches!

* Nature mode! Return to nature with some fresh air in the parks or go treasure hunting in caves!

* Procedural Gotchas! Massive procedurally generated arenas with increased challenge (and bosses), with customizable difficulty.

* Layout Absurdification! A module that attempts to create more interesting maps by forcing certain shape rules in the grammar set to be much more prominent!

* LOTS and LOTS of new shape rules such as new steepness shapes, new liquid shapes, new shape of all sorts. Above 200% more shapes than vanilla! (or at least 200% new lines...)

#### New Architectural Elements!

* Beams! Just like Oblige 3.x and 6.x, beams have a chance of appearing between borders of varying ceilings, floors and liquid zones!

* Naturalistic parks! Parks can now have natural-looking cliffs!

* Steppy caves! Making a triumphant return from earlier Oblige versions, spelunking has never felt more satisfying!

* Porches/gazebos! Be careful, one might be out to get you!

* New vista types, such as bottomless pits, gradual falling cliffs, and oceans!

* Buildings with windows that open into vistas!

* New control to select ceiling and floor sink styles: curved and flowy, or sharp and angular.

#### New Cosmetic Features!

* PsYcHeDeLiC theme. VAYP NAYSH, YA'LL.

* Armaetus's Epic Textures pack, now integrated from Oblige 6.x, now with awesome new textures used for ObAddon banners and vending machines!
  * Includes an Environment Themes system, enabling outdoor sections to be either desert-ish or snowy!
  * Also includes Custom Trees, available in either ZScript or ACS/Decorate formats! (ACS/Decorate format still in-progress)

* Quite literally exploded name generator with lots of new words and combinations!

#### ZDoom Stuff!

* ZDoom Story Generator! Make Doomguy do something different each time you play and give yourself something to read in-between your demon face-blasting!

* ZDoom fog! With the ZDoom Special Addons module, you can now get parametric fog (based on the Sky Generator inputs) within the levels!

* Fauna mode - add some creepy crawlies to your maps to further enhance the atmosphere!

* Glorious 3D multi-sector skyboxes!

* Custom quit messages and intermission pictures!

* Episode selection?! **In my Doom 2 WAD?!**

* Dynamic lights! Now with Doom 64 style colors for that nostalgia!

#### Expanded Fine Tune!

* Exposed parameters for the Sky Generator such as day/night and mountain settings. Play an entire generated WAD at night mood... for the mood.

* Toggle for turning prebuilt levels on or off!
  
* Expanded controls for monster setting, such as trap style, monster mix-it-up fine tune, and monster placement inside secrets and traps.

* Change global light setting with Brightness Offset control!

#### Expanded Debug Control

* Live Growth Minimap! Watch Oblige build a level in front of you - just like a Japanese teppanyaki chef!

* Prefab Control module - can control the amount of detail desired for the map, for your visual preference or for stability.

* Expanded prefab error reporting - you too, can make your own fabs and test them out.

#### Lots and lots and lots of bugfixes from base Oblige 7.7!

AND MORE TO COME!
