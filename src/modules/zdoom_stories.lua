  _RAND_ENTITY_TECH = name of a computer or AI from the table below
Some keywords for parsing later on:

  _SPACE = creates a linebreak

  _RAND_DEMON = name of a demonic entity
               (based on the GOTHIC entity names table)

  _RAND_ENGLISH_PLACE = name fetched directly from the Anglican
                        noun generator.

  _EVULZ = a rank title for a demonic entity based
           on the evil titles table below.

  _RAND_CONTRIBUTOR = name of a random contributor
                      (actually based on the specific
                      contributors table under TITLE)

  _RAND_GAL
  _RAND_GUY
  _RAND_HUMAN = names for a mere mortals (there is no human name generator
               yet as of 2019-04-09)

  _GOTHIC_LEVEL = name from the gothic level generator

  _MCGUFFIN_HELL
  _MCGUFFIN_TECH = returns a name of a plot McGuffin from the McGuffins
                   table below.

Notes and Tips:

* Hooks are the 'pull' of the story as per D&D terminology, a method
  of getting the characters' attention towards something. When writing
  hooks, make it as universal as possible i.e. the situation can start
  at any point of play.

* Conclusions are the resulting effect after a hook has been engaged.
  Conclusions can vary from positive, to negative, or even weird results.
  Be creative!

* For each story chunk under the STORIES table, there can be any number
  of hooks and conclusion per story.

* Hooks are placed at any point before the end of the episode
  but preferably at least in the first few maps of that episode.
  Conclusions are strictly placed at the end of each episode so
  it meshes with the climax of a boss battle or procedural gotcha.

* Don't make the stories too long! Remember, they have to fit the intermission
  screen. You can make it long enough to fill the whole screen and the
  Story Generator formatting code will try to fit the lines within
  the intermission screen as best as possible.

* Addendum: Also try to avoid extremely long words. The parser expects that
  lines will be 35 characters long to fit the constraints of the engine.
  Amount of lines is also limited.

* Doomguy doesn't care about story. But we do, we can just keep saying
  things about things he ends up doing, so be creative.

* If you are using np++, hit ALT+4 (not ALT+F4!!!) to collapse groups
  down to the story chunk pieces. This will make it easier to navigate.
