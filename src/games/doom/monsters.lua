-- Usable keywords
-- ===============
--
-- id         : editor number used to place monster on the map
-- level      : how far along (over episode) it should appear (1..9)
--
-- prob       : general probability of being used
-- crazy_prob : probability for "Crazy" setting (default is 50)
--
-- health : hit points of monster
-- damage : total damage inflicted on player (on average)
-- attack : kind of attack (hitscan | missile | melee)
-- density : how many too use (e.g. 0.5 = half the normal amount)
--
-- float  : true if monster floats (flies)
-- invis  : true if invisible (or partially)
--
-- weap_needed : weapons player must have to fight this monster
-- weap_min_damage : damage (per second) of player weapon required
-- weap_prefs : weapon preferences table (usage by player)
-- disloyal   : can hurt a member of same species
-- infight_damage : damage inflicted on one (or more) other monsters
--
--
-- NOTES
-- =====
--
-- Some monsters (e.g. IMP) have both a close-range melee
-- attack and a longer range missile attack.  This is not
-- modelled, we just pick the one with the most damage.
--
-- Archvile attack is not a real hitscan, but for modelling
-- purposes that is a reasonable approximation.
--
-- Similarly the Pain Elemental attack is not a real missile
-- but actually a Lost Soul.  It spawns at least three (when
-- killed), and often more, hence the health is much higher.
